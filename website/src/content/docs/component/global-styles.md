title: <GlobalStyles />
# description:
---

Places the common CSS used by the standard components of this integration with the `<style>` attribute specifying `is:global`.

Normally, it is placed in a common layout and applied to the whole site as follows.

```astro ins={3,18}
// src/layout/Layout.astro
---
import { GlobalStyles } from 'astro-image-processor/components';
---

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Astro Image Processor</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Astro Image Processor</h1>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>

<GlobalStyles />
```

Includes the following:

- Placeholder animation for the `<Picture>` component
    - Includes JavaScript for initialization
    - If JavaScript is disabled, the animation is skipped, and the placeholder falls back to the `background-image` or `background-color` of the `<img>` element
- Common classes for elements generated by standard components
- Classes corresponding to the `layout` property of standard components
- Classes corresponding to the `objectFit` property of standard components

The class names used can be changed in [globalClassNames in the integration settings](/astro-image-processor/configuration/reference/#globalclassnames).

If you change them, you need to create and place global CSS with the corresponding class names yourself.
